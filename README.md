Easily re-wrap comments to a given line width.

<img width=600 src="demo.gif">

Turns this:

```js
// this is
// my comment that
// does not wrap properly
```

Into this:

```js
// this is my comment that does not wrap
// properly
```

Supports:

- ✅ Standard (JavaScript/TypeScript/Java etc.) style comments ( `//` )
- ✅ Block comments ( `/* */` )
- ✅ Dart-doc comments ( `///` )
- ❌ Anything else (Python, bash etc.) **yet**
